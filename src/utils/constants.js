I can help you with questions about how to use Customer Data Platforms (CDPs) like Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap.

Ask me questions like:
- "How do I set up a new source in Segment?"
- "How can I create a user profile in mParticle?"
- "How do I build an audience segment in Lytics?"
- "How can I integrate my data with Zeotap?"

What would you like to know today?`;

  segment: {
    "set up a new source": `To set up a new source in Segment:

1. Log in to your Segment workspace
2. Navigate to Sources in the left sidebar
3. Click "Add Source" button
4. Search for and select the source type you want to add
5. Follow the configuration steps for your specific source
6. Name your source and click "Add Source"
7. Follow the implementation instructions provided

For website sources, you'll need to add the Segment snippet to your site. For server-side sources, you'll need to install the appropriate library.`,

    "implement in website": `To implement Segment in your website:

1. Log in to your Segment workspace
2. Go to Sources and add a new JavaScript source
3. Copy the Segment snippet provided
4. Paste the snippet in the <head> section of your website, before the closing </head> tag
5. Initialize the analytics object with your write key
6. Start tracking events using analytics.track() method
7. Track page views with analytics.page()
8. Identify users with analytics.identify()

Example implementation:
\`\`\`html
<script>
  !function(){var analytics=window.analytics=window.analytics||[];if(!analytics.initialize)if(analytics.invoked)window.console&&console.error&&console.error("Segment snippet included twice.");else{analytics.invoked=!0;analytics.methods=["trackSubmit","trackClick","trackLink","trackForm","pageview","identify","reset","group","track","ready","alias","debug","page","once","off","on","addSourceMiddleware","addIntegrationMiddleware","setAnonymousId","addDestinationMiddleware"];analytics.factory=function(e){return function(){var t=Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);t.unshift(e);analytics.push(t);return analytics}};for(var e=0;e<analytics.methods.length;e++){var key=analytics.methods[e];analytics[key]=analytics.factory(key)}analytics.load=function(key,e){var t=document.createElement("script");t.type="text/javascript";t.async=!0;t.src="https://cdn.segment.com/analytics.js/v1/" + key + "/analytics.min.js";var n=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];n.parentNode.insertBefore(t,n);analytics._loadOptions=e};analytics._writeKey="YOUR_WRITE_KEY";analytics.SNIPPET_VERSION="4.13.2";
  analytics.load("YOUR_WRITE_KEY");
  analytics.page();
  }}();
</script>
\`\`\``,

    "track events": `To track events with Segment:

1. Make sure the Segment snippet is properly installed on your site
2. Use the analytics.track() method to record user actions
3. Provide an event name and optional properties

Example:
\`\`\`javascript
analytics.track('Button Clicked', {
  buttonName: 'Sign Up',
  buttonColor: 'blue',
  signupMethod: 'email'
});
\`\`\`

Best practices:
- Use descriptive event names in past tense (e.g., "Product Added" not "Add Product")
- Be consistent with naming conventions
- Include relevant properties with each event
- Group related events with category property
- Document your tracking plan`
  },

  mparticle: {
    "create a user profile": `To create a user profile in mParticle:

1. Log in to your mParticle dashboard
2. Initialize the mParticle SDK in your application
3. Use the identify method to create or update a user profile
4. Provide a customer ID and user attributes

Example in JavaScript:
\`\`\`javascript
// Initialize mParticle
window.mParticle = {
  config: {
    isDevelopmentMode: true,
    identifyRequest: {
      userIdentities: {
        email: 'user@example.com',
        customerid: '123456'
      }
    }
  }
};

// Later in your code, identify the user
mParticle.Identity.login({
  userIdentities: {
    email: 'user@example.com',
    customerid: '123456'
  }
});

// Set user attributes
mParticle.Identity.getCurrentUser().setUserAttribute('firstName', 'John');
mParticle.Identity.getCurrentUser().setUserAttribute('lastName', 'Doe');
mParticle.Identity.getCurrentUser().setUserAttribute('premiumUser', true);
\`\`\`

User profiles will be created automatically when you identify users and will be updated with any attributes you provide.`,

    "track events": `To track events with mParticle:

1. Initialize the mParticle SDK in your application
2. Use the logEvent method to track user actions
3. Specify the event name, type, and attributes

Example in JavaScript:
\`\`\`javascript
// Track a custom event
mParticle.logEvent(
  'Button Clicked',
  mParticle.EventType.Navigation,
  {
    buttonName: 'Sign Up',
    buttonColor: 'blue',
    signupMethod: 'email'
  }
);

// Track a commerce event
var product = mParticle.eCommerce.createProduct(
  'Product Name',
  'SKU-123',
  19.99,
  1
);

var transactionAttributes = {
  Id: 'T-123',
  Revenue: 19.99,
  Tax: 1.99
};

var customAttributes = {
  couponCode: 'SUMMER20',
  storeId: '123'
};

mParticle.eCommerce.logPurchase(
  transactionAttributes,
  [product],
  customAttributes
);
\`\`\`

mParticle supports different event types:
- Custom Events
- Screen Views
- Commerce Events
- User Attribute Changes
- User Identity Changes`
